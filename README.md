This repository contains DNS codes for the incompressible fluid equations in periodic geometeries in 4 different flavours;      2D Navier-Stokes, 3D Navier-Stokes, 3D Euler and 3D Boussinesq.      All codes utilise GPU acceleration via the CUDA API and use Fourier pseudospectral spatial discretisation in all directions.
