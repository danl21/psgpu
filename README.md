This repository contains DNS codes for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in periodic geometeries in 3 different flavours;      2D, 3D and 3D with variable density (Boussinesq).      All codes utilise GPU acceleration via the CUDA API and use pseudospectral spatial discretisation in all directions.
